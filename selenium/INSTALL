A Python virtualenv is recommended (both in Linux and Windows) to have a valid python environment independent from the system python environment.

This virtualenv must contain the modules listed in the requirements.txt file.

PROCEDURE TO CREATE A VIRTUALENV (for Debian GNU/Linux):

1. Have the package python-virtualenv (or python3-virtualenv) installed in your system.

2. Select a directory OUTSIDE YOUR PROYECT PATH (e.g. "../venv" in parallel with the Git image).

3. Launch

   virtualenv <VIRTUALENV_PATH>

4. "Activate" your virtualenv on your shell

   . <VIRTUALENV_PATH>/bin/activate

   a (<VIRTUALENV_PATH>) should be added to your prompt.

5. Upgrade pip and setuptools within the virtualenv

   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install --upgrade setuptools

6. Install the required modules

   pip install -r <REQUIREMENTS.TXT file>

You can deactivate it by launching:

   deactivate

PROCEDURE TO USE A VIRTUALENV

The virtualenv must be activated BEFORE launching any python script.

For command-line sessions this can be done in the shell that you are using to launch the program.

   . <VIRTUALENV_PATH>/bin/activate

If the script needs to be launched externally (e.g. from a web server) a wrapper script can be created with the content.

#!/bin/sh

. <VIRTUALENV_PATH>/bin/activate

python <PYTHON_FILE.py> "$@"
