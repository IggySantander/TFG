** Splash

*** TODO Find way to return array from lua code in splash

In script2

    elements=splash:select_all('a[href*="www.ingrammicrocloud"]')

elements is supposed to be an array but 

INTERPRETATION:  It seems the problem is not the array but the type of the elements of the array.
For some reason they cannot be automatically passed to JSON.

In here: https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash/issues/557

the solution is to explicitely get node.OuterHTML() as decided in https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash/issues/564

Just a supposition

*** TODO Add in the code instructions to run the scrapy

Don't rely on the TFG document, the code should be autonomous for this.

*** TODO Use gitignore for .pyc and geckodriver.log.  Remove them from git first
